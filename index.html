    <h1>Kitty Cat</h1>
    <p> According to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279393787002385">one Australian study</a>, cat owners do have better psychological health than people without pets. On questionnaires, they claim to feel more happy, more confident, and less nervous, and to sleep, focus, and face problems in their lives better.</p>

    <p> Before the stressful tasks began, the cat owners had a lower resting heart rate and blood pressure than people who didnâ€™t own any pets. And during the tasks, the cat owners also fared better: They were more likely to feel challenged than threatened, their heart rate and blood pressure were lower, and they even made fewer math errors. Out of all the various scenarios, cat owners looked the most calm and made the fewest errors when their cat was present. In general, cat owners also recovered faster physiologically.</p>
